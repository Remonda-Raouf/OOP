📌 Object-Oriented Drawing System - Java

This is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project in Java that involves converting a UML diagram into actual Java code. The project demonstrates inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces, while dynamically creating objects using command-line arguments.

---

🚀 Features

✔ Convert a UML diagram into Java code, implementing interfaces and abstract classes.
✔ Support for drawable shapes such as Circle and Cube.
✔ Calculate the area and perimeter for 2D shapes and volume for 3D shapes.
✔ Use arrays to store and manage shapes dynamically based on command-line input.
✔ Option to read data from a file to create shapes (Bonus).
✔ Support for a GUI interface for input and output (Bonus).

🛠 Technologies Used

🔹 Programming Language: Java
🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
🔹 Interfaces and abstract classes for better code organization.
🔹 Arrays for storing and managing shapes dynamically.
🔹 File handling for input and output (optional).
🔹 Swing or JavaFX for building a graphical user interface (GUI).

---

📜 How to Use

🔹 Run the program using command-line arguments to create and manage shapes dynamically. Example:

java DrawableTest 2 circle 22.5 cube 23.6

🔹 This command creates an array of size 2, where the first item is a circle with radius 22.5, and the second is a cube with a side length of 23.6. The program will then calculate and print the total area of all Drawable objects.
🔹 Optionally, use a text file as input instead of command-line arguments, containing data like:

2 circle 22.5 cube 23.6

🔹 If a GUI is implemented, users can enter shape data through an interactive form instead of the console.

🎯 Suggested Improvements

🔹 Store shape data in a file to save and retrieve created objects later.
🔹 Enhance the GUI with JavaFX or Swing for a better user experience.
🔹 Allow advanced shape editing options, such as modifying or deleting shapes from the array.
🔹 Expand the system to support additional shapes, such as rectangles and spheres.

💡 This project serves as a practical implementation of OOP principles in Java, focusing on geometric shapes and dynamic data handling!
